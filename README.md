# ML-recognize-audio-signals
Project made during our bachelor course of Audio Signals.
The target was to recognize a specific source signals from noise using a microphone array composed by 16 mics.
We did this project using some usefull formulation like the Delay and Sum algorithm and some machine learning algorithm to find perfect parameters.
Done @PolitecnicoDiMilano.
